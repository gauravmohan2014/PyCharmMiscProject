Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
Displays the final sum.

Assignment 3 - Task 1 & Task 2

Task 1 Functionality: A Python program that:
Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
Returns the calculated factorial.
Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Task 2 Functionality: A Python program that:
Asks the user for a number as input.
Uses the math module to calculate the:
o   Square root of the number
o   Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
o   Sine of the number (in radians)
Displays the calculated results.

Assignment 4 - Task 1 & Task 2

Task 1 Functionality: A Python program that:
Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
Prints its content line by line.
Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Task 2 Functionality: A Python program that:
Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
Appends additional data to the same file.
Reads and displays the final content of the file.

Assignment 5 - Task 1 & Task 2

Task 1 Functionality: A Python program that:
Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
